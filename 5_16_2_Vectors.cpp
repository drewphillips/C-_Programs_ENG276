/*



Write a C++ program to work with 2-dimensional vectors.  Your program must â€¦

    Read in components for two vectors <x1, y1> and <x2, y2>.
        do not use an array structure and do not use a vector structure
    Provide a menu to select from the 5 options listed above
        scalar multiplication: use the same scalar for both vectors
        magnitude: calculate for both vectors
    Use a switch statement to calculate and print user selection to 2 decimal places
    Loop the menu until the user wants to quit
        more than one operation can be done on the same vectors
    Loop until the user wants to quit
        two new vectors are read in and new calculations performed
